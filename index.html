	In addition to these two perks that we all know and love about mortgages, getting one also ensures that our homes are protected as well! A mortgage is a loan used to purchase a home. It’s typically repaid over the course of many years and has an interest rate that changes periodically. Mortgage rates are usually lower than other types of loans, like credit card or personal loan rates. A mortgage can be an excellent investment vehicle because it provides people with the opportunity to build equity in their property while paying down the principal balance on their debt at the same time.
